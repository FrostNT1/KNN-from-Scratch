KNN Clustering Algorithm (non weighted)

I created a K Nearest Neighbour algorithm form scratch (ish) trying to show and elaborate upon the intricacies of the algortihm and further deepening the understanding and intuition behind the algortihm. It is no where near perfect or close to the algortihms you might find in various libraires, but it isn't meant to be.

I did use a few libraries to handle the data, some of which I could have avoided but I ended up using the library. You can try to create functions instead of the libraries (I recommend you do) to help furter cement you programming skils.
